# Restaurant Growth OS - Postgres Migration PRD

## Project Overview
Migrate the stable localStorage-based Restaurant Growth OS Checklist application to PostgreSQL persistence using Prisma ORM while maintaining 100% feature parity and zero downtime.

## Current State
- Stable Next.js application deployed on Vercel
- localStorage-based data storage (clients, progress, analytics)
- Prisma already configured with basic schema
- NextAuth integration ready
- Complex checklist system with progress tracking
- Google Ads and Meta Ads integrations
- Rich client management features

## Goals
1. **Zero Breaking Changes**: Maintain all existing functionality
2. **Feature Branch Development**: Proper Git workflow with thorough testing
3. **Database Migration**: Complete localStorage â†’ Postgres migration
4. **Data Integrity**: Preserve all existing client data and progress
5. **Performance**: Maintain or improve application performance
6. **Scalability**: Support multi-user/multi-tenant architecture

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema Design
1. **Enhanced Client Model**
   - Complete Client profile with all current localStorage fields
   - Location, branding, contact information
   - Google Ads/Meta Ads integration data
   - Account management fields

2. **Checklist System**
   - ChecklistSection model for organizing checklist categories
   - ChecklistItem model with rich metadata
   - ChecklistSubTask model for granular tracking
   - Progress tracking per client per item/subtask

3. **Progress & Analytics**
   - Client-specific progress tracking
   - Historical progress data
   - Analytics and metrics storage
   - Engagement events and action items

4. **Multi-tenant Support**
   - User-based access control
   - Client-user relationships
   - Role-based permissions (account manager, fulfillment)

### Migration Strategy
1. **Schema-First Approach**
   - Design complete Prisma schema
   - Generate migrations
   - Seed development database

2. **Dual-Write Implementation**
   - Write to both localStorage and database during transition
   - Read from database with localStorage fallback
   - Gradual migration of read operations

3. **Data Migration Tools**
   - Export utility for localStorage data
   - Import utility for seeding database
   - Validation tools for data integrity

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for all database operations
   - Integration tests for migration utilities
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Performance testing for large datasets

### API Layer
1. **Database Abstraction**
   - Create database service layer
   - Implement CRUD operations for all models
   - Handle relationships and complex queries
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **Migration Utilities**
   - localStorage export functionality
   - Database import functionality
   - Data validation and integrity checks
   - Progress tracking for migration status

### User Experience
1. **Seamless Transition**
   - No user-facing changes during migration
   - Automatic data migration on first database connection
   - Fallback to localStorage if database unavailable
   - Clear migration status indicators

2. **Data Backup & Recovery**
   - Export functionality for user data
   - Import functionality for data restoration
   - Migration rollback capabilities

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Schema Design (Week 1)
- Design comprehensive Prisma schema
- Create and test database migrations
- Set up development database environment
- Implement basic CRUD operations

### Phase 2: Migration Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- Build migration utilities (export/import)
- Create database service layer
- Implement dual-write mechanism
- Add comprehensive error handling

### Phase 3: Feature Migration (Week 2)
- Migrate client management functionality
- Migrate checklist progress tracking
- Migrate analytics and reporting features
- Implement data validation

### Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance (Week 2-3)
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Performance optimization
- Migration testing with real data
- Security review and hardening

### Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring (Week 3)
- Feature branch deployment
- Production migration strategy
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Rollback procedures

## Success Criteria
1. **Functionality**: 100% feature parity with localStorage version
2. **Performance**: No degradation in application performance
3. **Data Integrity**: Zero data loss during migration
4. **User Experience**: Seamless transition for end users
5. **Scalability**: Support for multiple users and large datasets
6. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Data Loss Prevention**: Multiple backup strategies and validation
2. **Performance Issues**: Thorough testing and optimization
3. **Migration Failures**: Comprehensive rollback procedures
4. **User Disruption**: Feature branch development and testing
5. **Database Connection Issues**: Fallback to localStorage mechanism
